You don't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK (not sure about US) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want. Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid; yellow fever; etc. Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school. In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come.

That said; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity (where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who haven't are covered to a large extent) and cases are low.

Each heme molecule has one atom of iron; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin; hence; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron. This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin.

Way back 2007; the limit is minimum 7;000...2010 onwards; they raised it to 10;000 due to higher cost of living. You cannot add wife's salary to make the 10;000...

A company that will move all my stuff without damaging anything; and possible pack it all up for me as well.

,,,,,,,,,,31-01-2007 12:35,NonFactual,Q34_R73_C8,Good,U1374,Mo_C,Hi All. I used Mr. Kabeer for my recent move within Doha. His price was very reasonable; a third of the price of the major moving companies. They packed everything up for me. I had to organise my own boxes which I did from QMart at the Mall; and they put all my stuff into them for me. They were quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage was incurred; but I had to supervise that they packed the fragile items carefully; and instruct them on what to put in each box. I strongly recommend him; but as with any move; supervise that the valuables and fragiles items are packed carefully or even better; by yourself. Also; be on hand to manage the packing.
,,,,,,,,,,05-12-2008 15:13,NonFactual,Q34_R73_C10,Good,U1378,gasiorowska,After reading your comments; I thought I'd give Mr Kabeer a ring yesterday. He arranged to come over... and I waited for 5 hours for him. When I tried to ring him to find out where he was; he didn't answer - I called four times. Then today he rang and said he was outside my place - apart from the fact that I'm working today and he's 24 hours late.... Hardly reliable; so just as well I'm not taking him On the upside; I tried Runway International. They turned up on time; took 10 minutes assessing everything and asking all the right questions... they may be more expensive than Kabeer; but at least they'll show up!

My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?,19-01-2007 11:42,NonFactual,Q36_R7_C1,Good,U2,anonymous,Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.

If its the former; best thing to do is call QATAR AIRWAYS and ask them. If it's the latter; then maybe there's a government agency you can ask? When my daughter was born (here in Doha); she didn't travel till she was 6 months old; but we were told the law was that she had to have a residency Visa within a month of being born....so by the time she travelled she had it. Hope that helps somewhat; and good luck. Stay safe all. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore; is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?

(he/she'll be crying all the way to your destination) if that's the case.
