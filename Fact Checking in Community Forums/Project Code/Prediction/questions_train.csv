the essence of a woman,Since we all came from a woman; got our name from a woman; and our game from a woman. I wonder why we take from woman; why we rape our woman; do we hate our woman? I think its time we killed for our woman; be real to our woman; try to heal our woman; cus if we dont we'll have a race of babies that will hate the ladies; who make the babies. And since a man can't make one he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one. ~ Tupac Shakur,Qatar Living Lounge,26-04-2011 13:14,Socializing,Q13_R20,U542,strawberry_shisha,Q13_R20,yes
